# HAL9000 animation

The images used by this project are derived from a source image,
which has been created by Jean-Claude Heudin. He gave permission
to use, modify and distribute his file for the purposes of this project.

The animated source image (haleye.gif) was copied from:
http://www.jcheudin.fr/playground/playground/hal9000/images/haleye.gif

For some other HAL9000 fun, check out his HAL9000 interactive game:

The script gif2bmp.sh converts the animated GIF into BMPs that are used
for different animation sequences. 
- wakeup: fades from black to image
- active: single images, used in a loop while active
- sleep: fades from image to black
The BMPs are numbered and stored in corresponding subdirectories.
