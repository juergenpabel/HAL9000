# Image sources

This project distributes images that are copied (and sometimes modified)
from other sources. Currently, images from two sources are used:
- Animations from the HAL9000 project, shown during system startup and shutdown
  - Source: https://github.com/armel/HAL9000/
  - Readme: [animations/README.md](animations/README.md)
- An animated HAL9000 (red) "eye", shown when interacting with the system by voice
  to indicate audio processing (aside from wake-word processing).

  - Readme: [sequences/README.md](sequences/README.md)
