# HAL9000
Open-source digital voice-assistant in a HAL9000 enclosure.

## Project goals
A digital voice-assistant that is...
1. actually usable (response times, error rates, ...)
2. performs everything on-device ("look ma, no cloud")
3. is entirely Free/Libre Open-Source-Software
4. is as-easy-as-possible to build

Not specifically a goal: price (although somewhat reasonable at 100-200â‚¬, depending on selection of components).

## Demos
Some showcase demo videos are published in the wiki: https://github.com/juergenpabel/HAL9000/wiki/Demos/

## Enclosure
The enclosure can be (mostly) 3D-printed, the STLs (generated with openscad, see resources/openscad/ in this repository) are on printables:
